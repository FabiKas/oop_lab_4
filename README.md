This project is designed to help me learn **object-oriented programming** in Python — especially **inheritance** — while also practicing key **Git concepts** like branching, merging, conflict resolution, and version history.

I will begin with a base class (`Creature`) and create additional subclasses on separate Git branches to simulate a real development workflow.

## Learning Objectives

### Python / OOP
- Understand and implement **classes**
- Use **inheritance** to extend behaviors
- Override and extend methods (e.g., `attack()`)
- Practice writing simple test code in `main`

### Git / Version Control
- Create and switch branches
- Merge branches into `main`
- Resolve merge conflicts
- View commit history (`git log --graph --all`)

## Project Structure
The programm is run by the run button in vs code or python3 creature_simulation.py in the terminal. 
There are 6 tests for the normal creature where the normal methods are tested that there are no errors.
Furthermore there is one test for each flying, swimming and fire creature. Where all methods are tested + also the values.
